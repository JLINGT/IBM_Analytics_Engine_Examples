# IBM_Analytics_Engine_Examples
Examples for IBM Analytics Engine (https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine/index.html#introduction)

I'm looking for feedback before developing these examples further.  Please send me your feedback, good and bad: chris.snow@uk.ibm.com


## Steps

- Clone this repository
- Install Python 3.x
- Install Jupyter Notebook on your client machine (http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run Jupyter Notebook `jupyter notebook`
- Find an example you are interested in and run it!

## Examples

### CLI

#### Pre-requisites

- In the browser tab opened by running `jupyter notebook`
- Walk through the steps in [examples/CLI/CLI_Setup.ipynb](./examples/CLI/CLI_Setup.ipynb) to setup the Bluemix CLI

#### CLI Examples

- Provision a basic IAE instance - [examples/CLI/Provision_IAE.ipynb](./examples/CLI/Provision_IAE.ipynb)
- Provision IAE with IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) - [examples/CLI/Provision_IAE_with_COS.ipynb](./examples/CLI/Provision_IAE_with_COS.ipynb)

## Project goals

- Provide executable documentation that is easy to run and find bugs in the documentation
- Provide documentation (recipes) for the many different tasks that you can do with IAE

## Help Wanted!
